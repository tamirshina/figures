          The project manager of Sergey’s Courtyard; born in 1828 in Perm, Antonin Kapustin’s town. Smyshlyayev came from a very distinguished family; his father was the mayor of Perm and his family dealt with trade.
In 1864 Smyshlyayev set forth to his first pilgrimage to the Middle East, during which he undertook the translation of books connected to the Holy Land and the cultures of the Middle East.
Smyshlyayev held the position of head of the Ural local council between 1870 and 1879; in the same years he also established a monthly journal called “The Perm Anthology” and published three books associated to his quests in the Holy Land - “The Journey to Sinai” (1878), “Sinai & Palestine” (1877) and a very thorough research on the Dead Sea and the biblical cities (1881).
In 1882, the year in which the Orthodox Palestine Society was formed, Smyshlyayev was appointed representative of Perm District in the Society’s council. In 1885 he decided to proceed to an additional pilgrimage and asked the council to release him from his duties for the sake of his quest. Instead, the council decided to assigned him the role of the Society’s representative in Palestine.
When Smyshlyayev reached the land of Israel, he discovered that it is entirely different from the land he visited a couple of decades before.
The task that was assigned to Smyshlyayev by the organization was to expand and develop the residential complexes and shelters designated to the pilgrims.
Smyshlyayev engaged in two grandios projects – Sergey’s Courtyard and the Alexander Nevsky site in the old city.
Much of the information we currently have concerning the purchase and construction of Sergey’s Courtyard originates from Smyshlyayev’s correspondence with Khitrobo, the initiator of the organization, and with Stefanov, the organization’s secretary.
After Smyshlyayev undertook the management of the project of Sergey’s Courtyard, almost immediately he came to realize the difficulties and complexities of erecting a structure according to Saint-Peterburg standards in Jerusalem before the modern era; scarcity of skilled workers, absence of suitable infrastructure and shortage in quality building materials. As a superintendent, he proved to be quite different from the other colonial representatives in the city: he cared for his workers’ job conditions, tends to their needs and sees in them an integral part of his vision about Sergey’s Courtyard. Consequently, he attracts workers of various ethnicities – Arabs, Greeks and Italians – all loyal to him and together they create a Russian masterpiece in the heart of Jerusalem.
Towards the completion of the construction of Sergey’s Courtyard, in 1887, the cornerstone of the Alexander Nevsky site is laid in the old city. In that location several archaeological findings came to the surface by Kapustin, most of which are dated back to the origins of Christianity. The complex, which was built like a basilica with a height of 10 meters and width of 22 meters, was designed and constructed with a special architectural element called ablaq, whose origin is found in the period of Mameluke rule in Jerusalem. Half of the complex was devoted to the Alexander Nevsky church and the other half was preserved for archaeological work. Smyshlyayev supervised the construction works and in 1891 the church is blessed with the Tsar’s name Alexander II.
The Patriarch of Jerusalem bestowed Smyshlyayev with the respectful title of “Knight of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre”, as an honorary award for his contribution to the city.

            Dr. Conrad Schick (1822 – 1901) was an architect, archaeologist, cartographer, researcher of the Holy Land and German Protestant missionary who lived and operated in Jerusalem during the second half of the 19th century.
            Schick was one of the prominent figures in the city of Jerusalem of his time, the last period of Ottoman rule, and is considered as one of the most significant researchers of the Holy Land and Jerusalem at the time.
            Conrad Schick served as a consultant for the IPPO for the project of Sergey’s Courtyard, participated in the excavations at Nevsky church site alongside Antonin Kapustin, aided in the restoration and renovation of the Mosque of Omar (the famous Al-Aqsa mosque) on Temple Mount. Furthermore, he was an integral part of the planning and construction of numerous neighborhoods and edifices in the city of Jerusalem.
            
            George Frangkie was a young engineer when he began working for the Russian Empire. Despite his young age, his captivating architectural style has contributed to the construction of some of the principal buildings in the landscape of Jerusalem, such as Sergey’s Courtyard, the church of Mary Magdalene and the Alexander Nevsky site. Frangkie, born in Nazareth and a subject of the Ottoman Empire of Greek origin, became the chief engineer of Jerusalem for a period of time.
            
            Martin Ivanovich Eppinger (1822 – 1872) was a Russian architect and member of the faculty of architecture in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint-Peterburg.
            In 1859 Eppinger was honored to be appointed as the chief architect of all the edifices of “Russian Palestine” in Jerusalem under the auspices of the Russian Palestine Committee. During the period between 1859 and 1865 he successfully led the completion of the Holy Trinity Cathedral, the complex of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission and the Russian hospital, all buildings that were erected in Jerusalem. For the sake of Russian Orthodox pilgrims he built the Elizabeth and Maria Courtyards as well as the building housing the General Consulate of Russia in Jerusalem. This complex of structures gradually came to be the architect’s main occupation. His works received honorary excellence awards from the Academy of Arts in Saint-Peterburg. Moreover, in 1862, following the request of the manager of the Russian Palestine Committee, B. P. Mansurov – the representative of the Russian Palestine Committee before the foundation of the IPPO – Eppinger was nominated the badge of the order of St. Stanislaus.
            Eppinger’s last project was the “Tiferet Israel” synagogue in the Jewish quarter of the old city.
            
            Alexey Efimovich Elkin (1870 – 1936) was the architect and the principal contractor in Nikolai’s Courtyard, the last building erected in Jerusalem by the IPPO. Elkin studied in the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint-Peterburg. At the age of 32 Elkin was hired to perform the construction of Nikolai’s Courtyard, fulfilling the requirement to house 1,200 pilgrims alongside the building standards of the city of Jerusalem. The budget was by all means inadequate but the creative freedom satisfied Elkin. Nikolai’s Courtyard has been in continuous use over 115 years and has survived two bombing attacks and four wars.
            
            Gottlieb Schumacher (1857 – 1925) was born in the United States to a family of German origin and came to be a very important engineer and archaeologist in the history of the Land of Israel and Palestine. Schumacher was the pioneer that discovered Megiddo, recommended the name “Haifa” for the city and contributed to the construction of a multitude of buildings all over the Holy Land. Schumacher was hired by the IPPO in 1901 for the construction of the Society’s complex in Nazareth, which in its zenith included a teachers’ seminar, a hostel and an ambulatory clinic.

            When I set foot in the Holy Land, I was surprised to discover an enigmatic and impressive figure among the people of our group. While still in the port of Jaffa, two men of remarkable stature and oriental appearance joined us. Both were elegantly dressed with a white robe covering their body from the chest till the knees, colorful vests and a leather belt. On their heads a tall red hat with black strings hanging from its middle. On each one’s waist a pistol is hanging with a round handle made from an ivory-like material, a cylinder with 5 cartridges and relatively long barrel compared to the rest of the pistol’s size. On the other side of their belt they had a Turkish-style long rounded sword. This man’s appearance brings to mind the various descriptions of the crusaders’ Muslim enemies, against whom they fought for the Holy City of Jerusalem. What are these same people doing on our side? Can they be trusted? 
            A short while before I first observed them, I heard one of the pilgrims telling their story. According to the Ottoman Sultan, only the Muslim civilians of the Empire were allowed to carry arms around the Empire’s territories. When a high-ranked foreign national would visit any place in the Ottoman Empire, they would get always escorted by a personal guard called Kavas. The word “kavas” means “bow” in Turkish. In ancient times any Kavas bore a bow and arrows on his back, a sword on his belt and a baton in his hand. Whenever they would strike the land with their baton, they were actually signaling the people surrounding their path that a specifically important figure is passing by and that it is advisable to everyone no to go too close to the Kavas-accompanied person if they value their body complete.
            The same Kavas guards escort us, the pilgrims. First and foremost they defend us from robbers and haters with ill purposes. When our group crosses the paths towards the holy sites of Tiberias and Bethlehem, a Kavas rides first in the front of our convoy and one in the rear.
            Apart from the necessary defence, the Kavas guards instruct us how to behave properly. We, who came from Russia’s heart, are not fluent in the languages of the Holy Land, not knowledgeable of the local customs; our whole being was foreign for this eastern world. We could easily be deceived, lose our way in the alleys of Jerusalem or worse, in the Judean desert. Therefore, we were ultimately grateful to the Society that provided us with accompaniment since the moment we set foot on the beach by the port of Jaffa until the moment we boarded our ship by the end of the pilgrimage journey.
            Out of all the Kavas guards collaborating with the Society, one Kavas stood out – Marko Djuric. As one of the fellow pilgrims described him: “Famous thanks to his own efforts, Marko was of Montenegrin origin, was fluent in six languages and open to help pilgrims from all origins and under all circumstances. In every way we passed through, pilgrims would always walk or sit by his side listening to his stories that illuminated every site they saw with their own eyes. He was a guide, a guard and a friend”.

            In front of me in the street an elderly man with a long gray beard is walking; his eyebrows crumpled, his glasses dark with notes of purple color. On his back a sack full of torments and in his hand a wooden walking staff reinforced with iron. He comes with stories and blessings, his clothes bear the aroma of incense. He does not possess money or property at all, he devoted his whole life to pilgrimage and, without exaggeration, he has made the journey from Russia to Jerusalem twenty times already. Such is the story this special man himself recounted to me and such is the story all the people who make the journey and meet him know. His shoulders pulled back, he stands upright as the captain of a ship. In his long frost-covered way to Jerusalem from Russia he is roaming in the night from house to house seeking shelter.
            Abraham knocks on the door using his staff three times and in his deep bass voice he says “In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit”. The family, sitting around a samovar, stares in silence at the man standing upright by the door at the threshold of their household. The lamp above him illuminates his face. It always feels like he is one of the ancient saints roaming our world, still not taken to Paradise.
            The family stops the conversation for a short while and silently remain cross-handed until the head of the house utters “Amen”. In such a way Abraham enter the house, he is the bell of G-d and his presence is a blessing by itself. In the morning he does not ask for anything, he just receives. The man of the house provides him with a little money, bread, fruit and maybe a chain or rosary in order to perform the ritual of immersion in the holy Jordan river. The man of the house rests assured that his guest will request the priests in the holy monasteries to pray for the sake of his family.
            When Abraham was seven years old, his father narrated him stories of pilgrims and already back then he knew that he wants to reach Jerusalem. He began saving money in a small pocket bag. When his small bag got filled, he initiated his journey without letting anyone know. When an old carter crossed his way, Abraham asked him “Where are you heading to?” and the carter answered “To Jerusalem”. Juvenile Abraham gazed at the carter with glowing eyes. “If this is the case”, said the old man, “you should join me, come and jump on the cart”.
            The child immediately jumped on the cart and swiftly fell asleep on a pile of hay for some time. Finally, he heard a familiar voice “Get up, get up!”.
            “Where am I?”, asked Abraham; “In the holy city, Jerusalem!” answered the voice gently. “What, what?”, he uttered, as he looked around and saw his mother standing by the dorrstep. The carter took him back home.
            From this same moment onwards the pilgrimage spirit grew more than vivid in his heart.
